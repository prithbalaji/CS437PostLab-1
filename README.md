# CS437PostLab-1


Create a github repo with separate script folders for each assignment below. Include 3 videos of your functioning codes in the readMe page of your github repo. Submit the repo link on canvas and make sure itâ€™s accessible to anyone with the link to repo (Due Sept 13th).

 

Post Lab Assignment-1 (3 points):  Develop a program that enables the movement of a solitary pixel (represented by a single LED) within the SenseHat matrix. Control this pixel's movement using the Joystick interface. For example, assume the initial (x,y) coordinates of the pixel to be illuminated is set as (3,5). When the joystick is pushed in the right direction, the subsequent pixel along the positive X-axis should light up. Likewise, pressing the joystick upwards, downwards, or to the left should illuminate the respective corresponding pixel. Exit the program in case of the middle-click.

Post Lab Assignment-2 (3 points): While experimenting with the temperature sensor, you might have noticed that the readings from these sensors exhibit significant fluctuations when they are not rounded to the appropriate decimal places. How can you address this issue without using the rounding functions? Write a program that uses averaging to tackle this problem. Plot a graph for old temperature measurements w.r.t time along with the curated temperature measurements w.r.t time.

Post Lab Assignment-3 (4 points): Cameras are computationally intensive for Raspberry Pis. To optimize their use and efficiency, let us explore a practical application by integrating it with other sensing modalities. Write a Python program that utilizes the Sense-Hat module to estimate the presence of a person based on changes in  the ambient temperature or humidty. The program should automatically initiate video recording when the temperature/humidity changes by 1 degree Celsius and perform face recognition. (You can create the temperature/humidity change by blowing onto the sensors.)
